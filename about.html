      <h2>Sept. 2010</h2>
      <h4>Began studies at Carleton University</h4>
      <p>In 2010 I started the my postsecondary education at Carleton University. A few months into my program (Business), I realized it wasn't the right path for me. I completed my first year and decided I needed to move towards the art field.</p>

      <h2>June 2013</h2>
      <h4>Graduated from Algonquin College</h4>
      <p>After I finished my first year at Carleton I decided that I was going to enroll into the Photography program at Algonquin College. It was a 2 year program which I absolutely loved but I knew that I wasn't done my education quite yet.</p>

      <h2>June 2016</h2>
      <h4>Graduated from Algonquin College</h4>
      <p>The time had finally come, the time to graduate. I was excited and extremely happy that I had made my way to where I felt I belong and was the perfect fit for me. As part of my program I was required to complete an internship, which I had secured at Arctic Empire. I learned a lot and got to work on multiple projects such web design, ui/ux and branding. It was a great experience and I am very grateful for the opportunity.</p>
