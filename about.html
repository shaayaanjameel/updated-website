      <p>A few years back, following my high school graduation, I started off my post-secondary education in business. A few months in, I realized it was not my calling. I then made my way into the art field, where I felt passionate and fit right in.</p> 
      
      <p> I am a recent grad, for the second time, from Algonquin College’s Graphic Design program. My first diploma was in Photography. I’m an UI/UX enthusiast. Who says a complex and powerful tool needs to be just as challenging or difficult to learn and use — and that is where I can add value: to make things simple and user friendly. I also enjoy illustrating and exploring motion graphics… Oh and I have a slight obsession with minions.</p>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>So all in all I'm just an average person in search for a full-time challenge.</p>
      
      <p>Have any other questions? Don't be shy, feel free to shoot me an e-mail at hello@shaayaanjameel.ca.</p>
      
<!--      i have an immense passion for art and design and using that passion to help people with their businesses, hobbies, and brands. i specialize in print design, re-branding, and photography.i always put the needs of my clients first then add a little bit of my clean cut but edgy style into it as well.

photography: to add to websites, posters, albums, of your band, shops, and more. i enjoy dark and moody photography as much as i love sunny and bright photography. contrast is key.-->
